C is a general-purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, etc. C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Eqquipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972. The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language.",

Dr. Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1979, which first made its public appearance in 1985.C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, C++ is a fast and strongly-typed programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has large amounts written in C++. Most of the software from Microsoft like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer are also written in C++.C++ is faster than Python because it is statically typed, which leads to a faster compilation of code. Python is slower than C++, it supports dynamic typing, and it also uses the interpreter, which makes the process of compilation slower.",

Java can also be used to develop applications that work in a distributed manner.The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language. It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.Java is easy to learn. Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages. Java is object-oriented. This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.Java is a well-structured, object-oriented language, which can be considered easy for beginners. You can master it quite rapidly, as there are many processes that run automatically. You don't have to delve into “how the things work in there” too deep. Java is a cross-platform language.",

Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management.Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.Python is written in C (actually the default implementation is called CPython).Python is an open-sourcing programming language. Therefore, it is freely available for everyone to access, download, and execute. There are no licensing costs involved with Python. Companies can save money by working with Python.Overall Python is better than C++ in terms of its simplicity and easy syntax. But C++ is better in terms of performance, speed, vast application areas, etc.",

CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS concepts are definitely harder to grasp than HTML. Making a skeleton website is easy. But adding design to it is hard.HTML is used to structure the content on the web page. CSS is used to add style to the content of a web page. HTML provides display information of various tags to the browser. CSS enhances that information by providing styling to those same HTML tags.CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS filesThe main reason why HTML and CSS aren't considered programming languages is because they only determine the structure and the style of the webpage you're building. They don't contain any instructions like the other front-end languages.",

JavaScript is so popular that it's the most used programming language in the world, used as a client-side programming language by 97.0% of all websites.Both of these are computer languages that help in programming, but there is a major difference between JavaScript and HTML. While JavaScript (abbreviated as JS) is a scripting language, HTML is a markup language. We use HTML to create web pages or web applications.JavaScript simply adds dynamic content to websites to make them look good. HTML work on the look of the website without the interactive effects and all. HTML pages are static which means the content cannot be changed. It adds interactivity to web pages to make them look good.JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can easily be embedded with languages like HTML.",

This isn't true: Node. js can be used both on the frontend and the backend.It's simpler than Java. It's ideal for full-stack developers. It offers faster and easier code writing.
